if you want to download this project clone it directly in cmd.

therer are some files you have to change it like i used firebase for database and authentication 

firebase.js --> copy your config code in firebase and paste there .

another one go to the package.json and download all dependencies

npm install 
    OR
 yarn add
 
( run these commands )
